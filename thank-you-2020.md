# Thank You
Heya, now that I found a lot of new and very awesome friends, it's time for one of my traditions each year - to write a huge message to thank everyone who contributed to my well-being, learning, fun times, etc. This list is **not** ordered - I have shuffled it. You can jump to your entry, by typing something like: `https://github.com/QueenOfDoom/SlashHome/blob/master/thank-you-2020.md#username`. The username, has to be written in lower-case letters and spaces are replaced with `-`. There's a lot more I'd like to tell y'all, but I only got limited time, so I hope that these short texts will do :big_toocan_heart:! This was a tough year for all of us - the pandemic really went wild at times, but I believe and am very sure, that the next year will be awesome! I hope for the best to happen!

## Kami Shinjo
> *knows what schrödinger's box is cause I watched bunny girl senpai*

Kami, ('/kami/' not '/kæmi/'), I'm very glad to have met you! You're a very nice person, who always likes to help people and tries to be nice, you are very humerous and super cool to talk with! I certainly won't forget your love for Bandori, which is cool, since it added a lot of super neat music to my playlists. You are super supportive in general and helped me quite decently in improving my english writing, altho as you can tell by all those paragraphs, I still have a lot to work on ^^. Thanks a **lot** for organizing a reborn server and collect a lot of awesome people in one place. That makes me very very happy every time I think about it - I already feel like home in this server, since I spend an incredible amount of time in there, I hope it continues to blossom since that's what it deserves!

## Shane
> If you are ever feeling a**shaned** of yourself, you can **kami**. Everyone feels re**tari**'d or **spenn**t sometimes, like the world is **doomer**d or they woke up **grumpah** on the wrong side of the bed, but I **promise** you will see the **light** at the end of the tunnel. You just got to **bear** with the **stress** that comes with life and let **alimo** how you are feeling. No need to suffer in **agye**ny alone, as that will only **amph**lify your struggles. We **mangoo** somewhere and you can **zoe** what interests you. I will defend you from sadness like a **paladin** and battle all the negative emotions with a **pau pau pau** of punches until you **regine** your happiness! Life without you would be a **kazu**alty that my heart couldn't **rei**cover from. You are simply too **isaw**esome and just a **niphy** person overall, and it's almost like you have a **gur**avitati**en**al pull that cannot be **jaed**ed even when you are feeling down. Just remember that **slime**one **loves you** and have a **Mari** Christmas!  
I'm so **snowiee** that you had to read all these puns, but I'm pretty sure I got everyone

It'd be a shame not to include puns in the first few lines of your paragraph, since that's how our conversations started :sataXD:. You're a very wholesome person and an exceptional artist. Thanks a lot for moderating the fantastic server I now dare to call my home ^^, for drawing super awesome artworks and for being a super nice person with an awesome tast of music ^^. I will definitely hope to get more chances to hop into `auditorium` with ya, it's fun, I get to hear more new and wonderful music and enjoy some time while still being able to work in a productive way!

## Kazu Kun
> 2020 was the tutorial stage

ありがとうございます for all your contributions to my never ending road, full of adventures, called "life". You always entertain people even if it comes down to people mocking you (*stares at Spenno, Kami and Shane*), which is an awesome and rare character trait! You host wonderful talk shows and have, just like many people from this list - an awesome music taste! I still have [Houkai Sekai no Utahime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZLfaZMpe0) in my playlists and it won't disappear from there!

## SlimeLovesYou
> I request....a Duel

Heya Tempest, sadly I didn't get to talk much to you, hopefully that will change this upcoming year! I know as a matter of fact that you're a nice singer, since I trust tari's judgement :)! Also, I would like to mention that this is an adorable quote of yours, which now will remind me of you and how nice you are: *"I'll absorb all of your depression for I'm a slime that eats the pain away".* (SlimeLovesYou, 17th December, 5.39PM (UTC+1)).

## Regine
> Wait how many eggs???

Heya, thanks a lot for the awesome time, I could spend with you. In this small time, we've done a lot of cool things, which I am also looking forward to complete, such as finishing watching AoT, I can't watch that by myself :sweat:. You have an awesome hobby - typesetting manga, from which I did profit not just once, so keep it up - I love reading what you create! All the music sessions were super fun - I genuinly enjoyed your trolls :merryXD:, it was really funny. Also, I definitely will take my time and start learning Tagalog as soon as I have more time, so I can try to speak with you - that's going to take an insane amount of time to get there, but I think I can be persistent, so I'll give it my best shot! Also you were one of the people who helped me to overcome my shell, which I built up throughout the years.

## Grumpah
> Ultimate Guide to being a math nerd and wasting your time playing Fire Emblem

Thank you a lot for all the awesome time I could spend with you, I genuinely enjoyed it - whether it was music, mathematics or anime, you always had something extraordinary, which I did not know and was glad to find out. Your wholesome attitude always is a perfect addition to any conversation - you always see the bright side of any situation and are glad to help and entertain anyone. I love this personality and thus am very grateful to be one of the lucky people who got to meet you!

## Alimo
> Doomer's not gonna sleep if we do ditf now

Good day, Alimo ^^! I sadly can't tell that I know you very well, I just know that you're an awesome person, which got summoned on this server, which plays Warframe ^^! Maybe the reason for this is the time shift... Anyways, I'm getting Warframe soon - as soon as I have a Hard Disk to install it on :sataXD:. So If you'd be down, I'd love to play with you and Snowiee and possibly other participants, altho - fair warning: I'm not good at that game!

## Guren
> Education corner is general right?

I will always remember the day, where I invited you, then Snowiee invited you and you accepted. Nah, jk xD - jokes aside, you're a super awesome person, which I am very glad to have met! Altho you said, that you're going to lurk most of the time, you have a pretty average amount of messages (as I'm writing this: 292), which makes me really happy! I hope you're enjoying this, because I'm sure that everyone likes you with us as a Server Member! Now that I read back your chat history, I realize that it is mostly filled by emotes, which is hilarious xD! Again: thanks for being there, without you we surely would miss the funny and interesting additions you add to the chats!

## Promiselight
> Shane is gravel, bee is a pebble, and amph is a freakin boulder!!!!!!

This delightful paragraph is for you, Promise ^^! You know that I can't stop with the puns :sataXD:! So, thanks a lot for the incredible amount of wholesomeness you brought to the server - all the hugs you distributed were really awesome and heart warming! I will definitely continue enjoying the chats with you and I hope that chats with me are also, at least not annoying ^^! Also, have fun playing on your new Switch! I can tell without a shadow of a doubt that Kami and the rest of our Switch Players will have lots of fun playing with ya ^^!

## Agye
> Well, i play guitar and piano, and ukulele and sing

Heya Agye, I know you for quite a while and I know that you're an awesome person and that you can make people very happy, with what you say! You're a very talented musician and artist, combined with the interest in anime that makes you a very interesting person! I wish you the best of luck on your studies of Korean and hope that we'll keep chatting as much in the new year as we did in this one, if not even more :ShiroHeart:!

## Tari
> *take off shirt while wiring this part*

Now let's get to Miss Tari ^^. Very happy, that I had the fortune to meet you! Thanks to you I found a person I can play Go with, talk about interesting philosophical questions, etc! You know a lot of good music and you learn and know lots of interesting stuff ^^! Thanks to you I learned *the real* Othello, Sungka and a few other things ^^! I am genuinely looking forward to another year of happy moments, board games and music ^^! About the quote... I took it, because if you read it out of context... It's hilarious :sataXD:!

## Ampharos
*puts on some Caravan Palace*  
Yeah, so now we're talking. It's your turn ^^! Hopefully the king of the bathtub is doing great on this wonderful moment! I genuinely liked talking to you, I have not talked too much, but I now know roughly your music tastes and from the profile picture can guess what other interests you might have. Hope you're doing well and you will be able to offer a huge supply of super cool music, ranging from Electro Swing to Epic Music next year as well. Also, you got insane 3D-Modelling Skills if the Pokémon you 3D Printed is your creation ^^!

## Bear
> You don't need to **bear** with it though :NicoSmug:

Here, we go ^^. The Story Writer of the Year :)! Hope you're having a great start of the year as well Bear ^^! I hope for the best for you and wish to read more of your stories in the future! [The one](https://www.webnovel.com/book/wish-me-good-night_13158570705906905) you wrote so far, which you gave me the link for, is awesome! *One very little remark:* the Discord Invite you link in the Comments is invalid ^^. Just saying :)!  Anyways, in the next year, I hope that I'll get to hear you more often and I'll get to read your texts more often, because as I mentioned, you are a fantastic writer and you definitely have your way with words!

## Juvia Simp
> Did y'all know that people die if they're killed...

And here we are, another person I don't know very well and have yet to get familiar with ^^! One of the not so many facts I know about you is that you lost all your progress in Genshin, so I hope that you'll catch up on it as fast as your free time allows it! I hope that you will do great in your new year and that every passing second will be joyful ^^!

## Kami Isawa
> what is bandori?

You seem to be a friend of Kami and Shane, it's going to be fun to talk to you ^^! I couldn't tell that much about you from 35 Messages, from which a lot are short :sadcat:, but I'll hope that we can change that in the new year! I wish you best of luck in this new year and let's all hope that it will be a better year than 2020 has been ^^!

## Mangooo
> i should be doing my homework but my sketchbooks looking at me rn

For you as well, I'm sorry that I can't write much up, since I know you not for too long :sadcat:. I hope there will be a chance to get to know you better. If you're Kami's friend, you must be an awesome person, so feel free to message me any time, if you feel like chatting ^^! Also, have a great start into the new year. I hope you'll do great ^^!

## Mari
> mari christmas

Heya, Mari ^^. I wish you a mari new year :mariXD:.  
Pun Police: *arrives*  
So, jokes aside, this time I have been blessed to spend with you was really insanely entertaining! Each time you said something it was full of energy, even though you have gone through some hard times lately, your optimism never drops, which I quite like about you! It's awesome to see the spirit that never gives up - it's quite viral, you know - if you do this, you give others the feeling that they can handle their problems too, so thanks for that! Also, I believe that you were the first person to send a picture in the "old" server, I don't have it anymore, but I remember what kind of picture it was :sataXD:, very very brave of you - I couldn't pull of such a thing in a thousand years :sataXD:!

## Mumu Uwu
> *silence*

Only 3 messages :sadcat:. That's quite a few to make a statement about you. I hope that my wishes will suffice. I hope you will have an awesome start into the new year! I wish the best for you, that your goals will come true and that you will stay safe and healthy!

## NIPHY
> b.boop @Regine

The nifty person among us ^^! I hope I will get to talk to you more than I have so far, if I understood everything correctly, you're an awesome friend of Regine, so I'll look forward to talking to you :ShiroHeart:! I hope that you will have a breathtaking start into the new year and that we might share some memorable moments in the future!

## Otaku Zoe
> I just want good yuri and decent friends

Heya, first of all, I gotta ask, and yep, I spared that question for today, since today is a great day and I wanna find out, was the message that you posted in `#general` 25th December, at around 2:49AM (your time), your picture or not? If yes, that's hilarious. Anyways, to the real topic of this smol message ^^! Hope you will have an awwwwsome start into the new year and that you'll stay just as fantastic as you are!

## Paladin
> YALL HOMIES STAYING HYDRATED? HERE!

*as I'm writing this:* lemme take a sip of water before I approach this one.  
Alright, so, happy new Year, Paladin, we made it another year! I hope you're doing well and won't task me with finding out, the one way speed of light (just kidding xD, I enjoy destroying my brain and you know it :sataXD:). I await more interesting facts be it physics, mathematics or weird things that nature produces. I hope you stay hydrated and that the switch to the new year will be smooth for you. I know you got lots of stuff to do towards the new year, you are in a job, which is highly required during hard times and festive times - while the ones celebrate, the others work their (excuse me for that one) ass off, so you're doing a fantastic job and we all love ya! If we could take a bit of your work, I bet we would :)!

## Rei
> I'm not actually a person, but a brain in a jar with the sole purposes of reading yuri, shitposting, and dj-ing on random servers  

Well, let's get to Grumpah's (and not only) favorite brain in a jar!  
Thanks a lot for offering your super cool DJ Skills and even better brain power, for people who seek a great way of passing time, help aor support ^^! You have a great personality and you don't avoid struggles, but face them head-on, which I personally find a very cool quality! I hope that you will have an awesome new year, with great oppotunities and perfect moments!

## Dabdab
> *a quote I'll yet have to find*

You're a super wholesome and very talented person! You have an insane amount of skill concerning art and probably that expands to singing as well :nicoSmug:! I hope you'll have an epic new year and that you'll reach your goals, whatever they are! I'm looking forward to epic paintings and a lot of other new surprises in the new year!

## Snowiee
> how  
> to  
> sleep  
> for  
> 365  
> days  
> in   
> 24   
> hours   
> 101  

I love you and you know that, sorry for the mocking :sadcat:. Snowiee - the greatest Yuri Conaisseur of all time, shall have an awesome transition from 2020 to 2021. You gave me a lot of memorable moments, from watching Yell, to recalling marketing and the natural effects of anthropogenic greenhouse effect :sataXD:. For real, I genuinely enjoyed the time I spent with you, it was suuper fun and I hope we will spend not less time, but much more time texting and watching Anime this upcoming year! Thanks for being a great friend, I hope your 2021, will be just as awesome as everyone else's!

## STRESSCOMEON
> YOU GOT THIS MY DUDE- I BELIEVE IN U SO HARD BRO

I would be very conflicted if I'd have to pick the better artist between you and shane, so, I'll settle for [both](https://tenor.com/view/the-road-to-el-dorado-both-both-is-good-gif-8304204). I love how you draw and I'd love you to keep going! You are insanely talented. I hope that you'll have a great 2021 and that nothing will hinder you from evolving your art skill! Thanks a lot for this wonderful year - even tho we haven't talked too much, I'd definitely look forward to talking with ya some time!

## Spennorex
> screens be emitting light

Heya, here we are, one year down, another one to come ^^! You're a very techy guy, so I hope that in the new Year, you'll have lots of new equipment to play around with, that you might establish a cool network and that uni won't stress you too much! I'll try to, although I cannot promise, to have more time for playing games, like MC or Osu!, we'll see what the next year has to offer! In any case, I wish you best of luck in your personal life as well as in the things you're passionate about!

## Karipatta
> Curry is yes.

Heyyoo Mag / Kari, hope your slide into the new year goes as smooth as the curry pun in your name ^^! You have a great taste of music - I will not forget the Meme Jam :sataXD:! It was great! Hopefully the new year will offer us a lot of opportunities to talk and chill out. You're a very awesome person, and deserve all the best in this coming new year ^^!

## Kami Bayushi
> Shinjo-chan uses me as an armrest [...] I'm still growing [...] (ㆆ _ ㆆ)

Now let's get to you ^^ - the very talented sister of the awesome Kami Shinjo! I don't know you well, but I know as a matter of fact, that you're an awesome person, with lots of skill and dedication in your hobby, what I am always very glad to see! I hope we will continue receiving news about your artworks - and I'm sure that you'll be a professional (manga / anime) illustrator in no time ^^!  
I hope this new year will turn out to be a great one for you, that you will acquire lots of new techniques and sharpen your skill!

Long time no C, just python, judging from your code I guess :sataXD:! - You know me, I love puns xD! So hopefully this year will go easier on you and I hope that the load on you will reduce! Best of luck with your master thesis - I'm 100% sure, that you will nail it! I will try to text more often, than I used to, to keep checking on how you do / feel ^^. In my opinion it's important to [get help](https://tenor.com/view/thor-ragnarok-get-help-funny-throw-gif-14270786) if you're struggling, but in the end it's up to you, who you entrust with your life - if I am worthy, feel free to tell me :).  
I was very happy when I knew, that we still have a way to talk, so I gotta thank you for that! I'd miss talks with ya!

## Canter
> put it on pp github :P

G'Day Sir - excuse my foolish use of GitHub xD. Anyways - let's get to the real message! So, I know not much about you as well, I just know that you are a very interesting person, who enjoys Web Dev and administrates a huge Server, I know that you enjoy teaching, and thus hope that this quality will stay with you for long since this is a wonderful quality - even tho I'm biased, since I love teaching too xD. I hope that this new year will be an epic one for you - I hope that you will become even more proficient - there is always some room in the brain to fill with knowledge and experience! I also hope that the server will continue to grow, as it is very cool to have a large community - I hope more lurkers will become active and that the opportunities for cool events will arise more often :)!

## DukeTwo-Can
> Also, I love your emotes you use, they are awesome!  
> Me: **stares @Kami**

Heya, the generous person - what will we write for ya - *thinks*. Keep being like you are - generous, nice, giving and intelligent. One day... I'm telling ya, I'll catch up on your ML knowledge, so that I can spread the ways of computational intelligence and make you proud, but til that moment, I guess you'll have to wait for me. You always make the server shine with your positive attitude, so I'm grateful, that you're with us! I hope you will have an epic slide into the new year, that your niece will enjoy your gifts at least as much as I enjoyed yours.

## Reginsmol
> do you get paid for being a retard or is that non profit too?

Good day, Sir, that quote is one of the best roasts I've ever heard xD, you sure are good at those! I hope your year was as productive as you wanted it to be, thy goals shall be reached and thy happiness - fullfilled! Don't let yourself be dragged down by those who don't follow the rules, it's easier to ignore them than waste your time in order to tell them what's right, what's wrong. I genuinely hope that this new year will treat you well and that there will be lots of pleasant surprises!

## Rocambin
> May God bless you

Good day, Rocambin :). I wish you the best new year that the world has in store for you! I don't know you for too long, but I know that you deserve a great year to come - you're an extraordinarily nice person, so hope that it'll stay like this for a very long time! Your wonderful attitude shall seed happiness in people's hearts and your knowledge shall help people with whatever problems they might have! I hope that your own problems will fade in the new year and that you will be genuinely happy!
